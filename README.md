CrapOS web builds

NOTE: In the offchance that you're actually seeing this, **please don't use these.** They're very jank and don't entirely work properly. LÖVE is already very cross-platform so there is almost no reason you should need to use these. And yet someone ported LÖVE to the web anyways, because of course, webdevs and their unbridled insanity know no bounds.
